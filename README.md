# PORT SCANNER PYTHON3 PROJECT

This Port Scanner is a Python script that allows you to scan for open ports on a given host. It provides a simple and efficient way to check the availability of specific ports on a target system or network. The script utilizes multithreading to perform parallel port scans, enhancing the scanning speed. The result is displayed in the terminal, showing whether each port is open or closed.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Open a terminal and run the script using the following command:
	`python3 scanner.py <ip>`
	Replace `<ip>` with the IP address or domain name you want to scan.
4. The script will scan all ports on the specified host and display the results in the terminal. It will show the status (open/closed) for each scanned port.
5. After the scan is complete, the script will provide the total scanning time.

Please note that port scanning without proper authorization may violate the terms of service of your target system or network. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and use this tool responsibly.
